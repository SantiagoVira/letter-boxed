# NYT [Letter Boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed) Solver

The New York Times has a daily puzzle named Letter Boxed, in which words are created from a square with 3 letters along each edge. A word may only be used if no consecutive letters in the word share an edge in the puzzle grid. For each game, there is a pair of words that solves the whole puzzle. My code finds every pair of words that can solve each day's grid.

I ran into trouble finding a word list that resembles the one the game makers use. As the NYT does not publish their wordlist, some results may be false positives.
